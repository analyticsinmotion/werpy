test_normalize.py

This module contains unit tests for the 'normalize' function in the 'werpy.normalize' module. 
The 'normalize' function is responsible for normalizing translations, 
both reference and hypothesis, to facilitate word error rate (WER) calculations.

Tested functionality:
- Normalization of reference translations.
- Normalization of hypothesis translations.

Test cases:
- 'test_normalize_reference_translation': Test the normalization of reference translations.
- 'test_normalize_hypothesis_translation': Test the normalization of hypothesis translations.

Each test case compares the output of the 'normalize' function with the expected normalized translations 
and raises an AssertionError if the actual output does not match the expected values.

To run the tests, execute this module as the main program.

Note: If the 'normalize' module is not imported successfully, 
an ImportError is raised to ensure that the required module is available for testing.

    Test cases:
    - 'test_normalize_reference_translation': Test the normalization of reference translations.
    - 'test_normalize_hypothesis_translation': Test the normalization of hypothesis translations.
    - 'test_normalize_string': Test the normalization of a single string.

    Each test case compares the output of the 'normalize' function with the expected normalized translations
    and raises an AssertionError if the actual output does not match the expected values.
