test_summary.py

This module contains a set of unit tests for the 'summary' function in the 'werpy' package.

The 'summary' function calculates the Word Error Rate (WER) and alignment on an individual 
sequence basis rather than aggregated across a corpus. It takes as input a reference text 
sequence and hypothesis text sequence as lists of words. The output is a dataframe containing 
the WER, number of insertions, deletions and substitutions, and a listing of the specific word 
errors (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to align the hypothesis to the reference 
for that sequence pair. This provides transparent per-sequence WER analysis and error inspection 
rather than just an overall corpus-level WER.

To run the tests, execute this module as the main program.

For more details on the 'summary' function and how to use it, please refer to the 'werpy' package documentation.

Note: If the 'summary' module is not imported successfully, an ImportError is raised 
to ensure that the required module is available for testing.
