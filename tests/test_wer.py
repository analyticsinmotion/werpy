test_wer.py

This module contains a set of unit tests for the 'wer' function in the 'werpy' package. 
The 'wer' function is responsible for calculating the Word Error Rate (WER) between 
reference and hypothesis text sequences.

The module defines the 'TestWer' class, which includes multiple test methods to ensure 
the correctness and reliability of the 'wer' function. These tests cover various scenarios, 
including simple comparisons, multiple reference and hypothesis strings, and longer text sequences.
Each test case compares the output of the 'wer' function with the expected word error rate 
and raises an AssertionError if the actual output does not match the expected values.

The 'wer' function is a crucial component for evaluating the accuracy of text recognition and 
transcription systems. These unit tests aim to validate the accuracy of the WER calculations and 
provide confidence in the function's performance.

To run the tests, execute this module as the main program.

For more details on the 'wer' function and how to use it, please refer to the 'werpy' package documentation.

Note: If the 'wer' module is not imported successfully, an ImportError is raised 
to ensure that the required module is available for testing.
